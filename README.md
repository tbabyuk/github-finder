# Github Finder

## Description
A small web-app that allows a user to search for different Github profiles by name. The API returns 30 of the most popular profiles that fit the search query, and a user can then click on any one of these to view more detailed information on that particular user.

## Background & Motivation
This was based on a tutorial I had done a while back by a popular YouTube coding instructor. This time, however, I did completely my own implementation and gave it my own look and styling. I really like the idea of getting a list of information through an API and displaying it neatly on a page.

## Technologies
The current version of this project was done with:
* HTML, Bootstrap / CSS
* React
* Fetch API
* Custom fetch hook

## State of Completion
Completed. I could have added more information to the individual user profile but my goal was to keep it simple, with a focus on functionality first and foremost.

## Learning Lessons & Challenges
### Using a custom hook for Fetching data
I used to always fetch data inside components, but recently saw a video where the instructor shows how to do this a bit neater, with a custom fetch hook. So I decided to implement this for this particular project. This was great practice for me and I feel like I will be using custom fetch hooks more often going forward, as it keeps the component code cleaner by taking all the fetch logic outside of it.

### Displaying the list of Github profiles
I enjoyed the challenge of figuring out how to neatly display the fetched profile data and at the same time make it responsive on all types of screen sizes.

## Summary
I really enjoyed making this little app. While it's nothing fancy, I think it has a very clean look and feel to it that I am very pleased with.
